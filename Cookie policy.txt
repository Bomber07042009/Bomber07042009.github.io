Cookies are small text files that are transferred to your computer and registered on it by the websites you visit, with their subsequent sending to the same websites when they are visited again. It is thanks to these cookies that websites “remember” your actions and preferences (for example, login information, language, font size, other display options, etc.), so there is no need to re-configure them when repeated visits to websites, or when switching between pages of a website.
